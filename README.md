## [WorldCup18](https://worldcup18.co)

Live and interactive wall-chart for the 2018 FIFA World Cup tournament in Russia. Following EuroTwenty16.com 2 years ago, WorldCup18.co includes realtime data, scores, statistics and squad information. All 32 nations have a page with a colour-theme based on their kit colours. Squads, group standings, top scorers, live scores and match statistics are all loaded into the website through respective APIs, meaning upon launch all information is completely self managed.

## Tech Stack
